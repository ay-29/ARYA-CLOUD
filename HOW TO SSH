Certainly! Here are the steps to host a simple static web page on an EC2 instance with Ubuntu OS:

1. **Launch an EC2 Instance**:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
   - Click on "Launch Instance" and select an Ubuntu Server AMI.
   - Choose an instance type, configure instance details, add storage, and configure security groups (allow HTTP port 80 access).
   - Launch the instance and select an existing key pair or create a new one to connect to the instance securely.

2. **Connect to Your EC2 Instance**:
   - Once the instance is running, note down its public IP address.
   - Use SSH to connect to the instance from your local terminal:
     ```
     ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-instance-public-ip
     ```
   Replace `your-key.pem` with the path to your private key file and `your-instance-public-ip` with the public IP address of your EC2 instance.

3. **Install Required Software**:
   - Update the package list:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     ```
   - Install a web server like Nginx:
     ```
     sudo apt install nginx
     ```

4. **Configure Nginx**:
   - After installation, Nginx will start automatically. You can verify its status with:
     ```
     sudo systemctl status nginx
     ```
   - By default, Nginx serves files from `/var/www/html` directory. You can place your HTML files here.
   - You might need to adjust the file permissions:
     ```
     sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
     ```
   - Optionally, you can configure a domain name with Nginx. Edit the default server block configuration:
     ```
     sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
     ```
     Update the `server_name` directive with your domain name.

5. **Upload Your HTML File**:
   - Use SCP or SFTP to upload your HTML file to the `/var/www/html` directory on your EC2 instance.

6. **Restart Nginx**:
   - After uploading your HTML file, restart Nginx to apply changes:
     ```
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```

7. **Access Your Website**:
   - Open a web browser and enter your EC2 instance's public IP address or domain name. You should see your hosted web page.

That's it! Your static web page is now hosted on an EC2 instance running Ubuntu OS with Nginx as the web server.
